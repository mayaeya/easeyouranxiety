    <h2>"Breathing Techniques: How They Help with Stress and Anxiety" by Dovilė Bagdonaitė</h2>
    <p>Breathing techniques are simple yet powerful tools to manage stress and anxiety. When you're stressed, your body is making your breathing fast and shallow. Deep, controlled breathing can calm this response and help you feel more relaxed. Let's explore some effective breathing techniques and how they can make a difference.<p>
<p><strong>Why Breathing Techniques Work</strong><p>
<p>Breathing techniques help by:<br>
<br>Slowing Your Heart Rate: Deep breathing signals your body to calm down.<br>
<br>Lowering Blood Pressure: Controlled breathing can reduce tension and help your body relax.<br>
<br>Improving Focus: Focusing on your breath can distract you from anxious thoughts.<br>
<br>Balancing Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Levels: This helps you feel more grounded and less panicky.<p>
<p><strong>Simple Breathing Techniques</strong><p>
<p><strong>Deep Breathing</strong><br>
<br>This is the most basic technique. Here's how to do it:<br>
<br>Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.<br>
<br>Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.<br>
<br>Take a slow, deep breath in through your nose, filling your belly with air.<br>
<br>Hold for a second, then slowly exhale through your mouth.<br>
<br>Repeat for a few minutes until you feel calmer.<p>
<p><strong>4-7-8 Breathing</strong><br>

<br>Repeat 4 times.<p>

<br>Hold your breath for another 4 seconds.<br>
<br>Repeat the cycle 4 times.<p>
<p><strong>Diaphragmatic Breathing</strong><br>
<br>This technique focuses on using your diaphragm for breathing:<br
<br>Lie on your back with your knees bent or sit comfortably.<br>
<br>Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.<br>
<br>Breathe in deeply through your nose, ensuring your belly rises more than your chest.<br>
<br>Exhale slowly through pursed lips.<br>
<br>Practice for 5-10 minutes daily.<p>
<p><strong>Pursed Lip Breathing</strong><br>
<br>Useful for slowing down your breathing:<br>

<br>Inhale through your nose for 2 seconds.<br>
