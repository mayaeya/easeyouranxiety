    <h2>"How to Find Happiness" by Maya Šustickienė</h2>
    <p>In a world filled with insatiable desires for bigger, better, and greater, many find themselves constantly chasing after the next thing. Whether it’s material wealth, success, or recognition, the quest for more often leaves people feeling empty. True happiness and contentment seem elusive. But at the root of these endless desires lies something deeper: spiritual immaturity. Real contentment, as many have found, comes from a deeper source—God.<p>
<p>The apostle Paul’s life is a great example of this. Despite facing numerous hardships, including hunger, suffering, and imprisonment, Paul learned the secret to true happiness. He explained, "I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Philippians 4:11-13).<p>
<p>Paul didn’t seek out honour, power, or privilege for himself. Instead, he placed his trust in God, believing that happiness and contentment could be found regardless of his circumstances. His words remind us that external situations don’t determine inner peace. It’s about where we place our trust and how we view life.<p>
<p>Similarly, Hebrews 13:5 urges us, "Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you.'" This powerful message invites us to let go of envy and greed, knowing that God’s presence in our lives is enough.<p>
<p>One of the most powerful tools for finding happiness is gratitude. When we cultivate a thankful heart, we shift our focus from what we lack to what we have. Gratitude, as many say, "turns what we have into enough." It’s the antidote to greed and dissatisfaction. Proverbs 15:16 wisely reminds us, "Better is a little with fear of the Lord, than great treasure with trouble." In other words, it’s better to live simply and be at peace than to have endless wealth and be burdened with worry and stress.<p>
<p>Paul elaborates further on this in 1 Timothy 6:6-10: "Now godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out. And having food and clothing, with these we shall be content." He warns about the dangers of chasing after riches, as it leads people into temptation and harmful desires that can ultimately lead to destruction.<p>
<p>True happiness isn’t found in the accumulation of things. It’s found in cultivating a contented spirit, something that’s especially vital in today’s society where excess and materialism dominate. A content heart protects us from the endless cycle of wanting more and frees us to enjoy the present moment and the blessings we already have.<p>
<p>Gratitude and contentment are at the core of finding lasting happiness. When we shift our mindset from constantly striving for more to being thankful for what we have, we open the door to greater joy, peace, and fulfillment in our lives.<p>
