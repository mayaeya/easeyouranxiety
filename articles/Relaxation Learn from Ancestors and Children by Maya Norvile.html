    <h2>"Relaxation: Learn from Ancestors and Children" by Maya Norvile</h2>
    <p>In today's fast-paced, busy world, where stress and endless responsibilities pile up, burnout is a real threat. It's not just caused by having too much to do but also by not knowing how to truly rest. Simply lounging on the couch in front of the TV or spending hours online isn’t real relaxation—it’s just more activities that tire the body and mind. To find true rest, it’s worth learning from our ancestors and children.<p>
<p><strong>Sing</strong><p>
<p>Our grandparents were calmer and healthier, partly because they loved to sing. Whether they were relaxing in the evenings or working hard, they would sing. No matter what the task—whether they were spinning wool, braiding ropes, raking hay, plucking feathers, knitting, weaving, or herding animals—they always found time to sing. Singing doesn’t just bring joy; it also has a positive effect on the respiratory system, the nervous system, and the heart.<p>
<p><strong>Play</strong><p>
<p>While passive rest is important when you're completely exhausted and just want to collapse into bed and sleep, once you’ve rested a little, it’s time to switch to active rest. A great way to do this is through children’s games. For example, "hide and seek" is fantastic for relaxing tired nerves and muscles. You hide in a rush, hold your breath while waiting, then dash out as soon as you’re found. You run, shout with joy, and celebrate loudly. In short—it’s pure fun!<p>
<p><strong>Reconnect with Nature</strong><p>
<p>Our ancestors spent a lot of time in nature, and studies show that being in natural surroundings reduces stress and anxiety. Take a walk in a park, garden, or forest. The fresh air, the sound of birds, the feel of the ground beneath your feet—it all helps to ground you and calm your racing thoughts. Even if it’s just a few minutes a day, this connection to nature can have a powerful effect on your mood.<p>
<p><strong>Mindful Breathing</strong><p>
<p>Children naturally breathe deeply when playing, which helps regulate their emotions. You can bring that same level of calm into your life by practicing mindful breathing. Try taking slow, deep breaths, focusing on the air flowing in and out. This helps slow your heart rate and ease anxious thoughts. It's a simple, yet effective, technique that you can do anytime, anywhere.<p>
<p><strong>Creative Expression</strong><p>
<p>Just as singing was a form of expression for our ancestors, tapping into creativity today can be incredibly healing. Whether it’s through drawing, journaling, colouring, or even cooking, creative activities can help release pent-up emotions and serve as an outlet for your feelings. They allow you to express what’s going on inside in a way that words sometimes can’t.<p>
<p><strong>Gratitude Practice</strong><p>
<p>Children often find joy in the simplest things, and this sense of wonder can be incredibly healing. Taking a few moments each day to practice gratitude—reflecting on small things that bring you happiness—can shift your mindset. Whether it’s a delicious meal, a kind gesture from a friend, or even just a moment of quiet, acknowledging what you're grateful for can reduce stress and foster a more positive outlook.<p>
<p>Incorporating simple activities can bring profound relaxation and stress relief. Instead of scrolling through endless feeds or zoning out in front of screens, try these timeless methods. It’s amazing how such basic practices can help ease anxiety, calm the mind, and rejuvenate the spirit.<p>
