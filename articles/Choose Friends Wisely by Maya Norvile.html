    <h2>"Choose Friends Wisely" by Maya Norvile</h2>
    <p>Let’s be optimistic and look at life positively. When surrounded by gossipers, critics, and pessimists, it’s easy to sink into despair. Interacting with a perpetually grumpy neighbor won’t do us any good.<p>
<p>Do we absolutely need to pay off a loan? Then we should socialize with someone who knows how to have fun on a budget, not with those who spend every weekend shopping.<p>
<p>If we’re overly worried about our weight, we should find friends with fuller figures and have meals with them, not with an almost emaciated friend whose lunch consists of a cup of coffee and a cigarette.<p>
<p>If we want to reduce alcohol consumption, it’s important to be surrounded by reliable, health-conscious people, not the usual drinking buddies.<p>
<p>Let’s seek friends who support our goals, warn us about dangers we might not see, and genuinely help us get back on track. There are always people willing to help us grow, but there are also those who encourage bad behavior. If we don’t let go of harmful friends, we risk ending up at a dead end in life.<p>
<p>Of course, some people have been in our lives for many years, and it’s not always easy to cut ties with them. However, if they don’t support our new goals and chosen lifestyle, then we’re simply not on the same path anymore.<p>
