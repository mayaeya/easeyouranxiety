    <h2>"Stress: Part 3 - How Stress Affects You Physically" by Maya Norvile</h2>
    <p>Whether it’s work pressure, personal struggles, or even daily challenges, stress seems unavoidable. But while we often think of it as a mental issue, it doesn’t just affect your mind. It has a serious impact on your body as well. In fact, long-term stress can lead to various physical problems that can interfere with your health and overall well-being.<p>
<p>When you're stressed, your body goes into "fight or flight" mode, a survival mechanism that has been with us since ancient times. This response is designed to protect you from immediate threats, like running from danger. Your body releases hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol, which increase your heart rate, sharpen your focus, and prepare your muscles for action. While this can be helpful in short bursts, the problem arises when stress becomes chronic. Over time, your body remains in this heightened state, which can wear it down.<p>
<p>One of the most common physical signs of stress is tension in the muscles, particularly in the neck, shoulders, and back. You might feel tightness or even pain in these areas after a long day of stress. If this tension continues for an extended period, it can lead to more serious conditions, such as tension headaches or migraines. It's like your body is holding onto the stress, unable to relax.<p>
<p>Stress can also have a big impact on your heart. When you're anxious or under pressure, your heart rate increases and your blood pressure rises. This might not seem like a big deal if it happens occasionally, but if you're constantly stressed, it puts a lot of strain on your cardiovascular system. Over time, this can increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, and even heart attacks.<p>
<p>Your digestive system also takes a hit when you're stressed. You might notice that during times of high stress, your stomach feels uneasy. Stress can cause issues like indigestion, nausea, and in some cases, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It can even alter your appetite. Some people lose their desire to eat, while others may find themselves turning to comfort food, leading to weight gain or unhealthy eating habits. Either way, it's clear that your gut reacts strongly to how you’re feeling emotionally.<p>
<p>Sleep problems are another common physical effect of stress. When your mind is racing with worries or to-do lists, it becomes difficult to wind down at the end of the day. Stress can cause insomnia or restless sleep, and over time, lack of proper rest can lead to exhaustion, making it harder to function during the day. You may also feel mentally foggy or irritable because your brain simply isn’t getting the rest it needs to recharge.<p>
<p>Your immune system doesn’t escape the effects of stress either. When you're constantly stressed, your body’s ability to fight off illness is weakened. This is why you might notice you get colds or other infections more often when you’re under a lot of pressure. Stress causes your immune response to slow down, making it harder for your body to defend itself against viruses and bacteria.<p>
<p>Another surprising way stress can show up physically is through changes in your skin and hair. Many people experience breakouts or skin irritations when they're stressed. Some may even notice their hair thinning or falling out. This happens because stress disrupts the balance of hormones in your body, leading to these visible changes.<p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that long-term stress can affect your hormones and reproductive system. Women may experience irregular periods or more painful menstrual cycles, while stress can also decrease libido in both men and women.<p>
<p>In conclusion, stress is not just a mental burden—it’s something that can seriously affect your physical health. From your muscles and heart to your digestion, sleep, immune system, and even your skin, chronic stress takes its toll. That's why it's important to recognize when stress is becoming overwhelming and take steps to manage it before it leads to bigger health problems. Simple practices like relaxation, mindfulness, exercise, and proper rest can help keep your mind and body in balance, reducing the harmful effects of stress.<p>
