<br>Place Your Hands: Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly.<br>

<br>Hold: Hold your breath for a count of 7.<br>
<br>Exhale: Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whooshing sound, for a count of 8.<br>
<br>Repeat: Repeat this cycle for 4 breaths initially, and gradually increase as needed.<p>
<p><strong>3. Box Breathing (Square Breathing)</strong><p>
<br>Inhale: Breathe in slowly through your nose for a count of 4.<br>
<br>Hold: Hold your breath for a count of 4.<br>
<br>Exhale: Exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of 4.<br>
<br>Hold: Hold your breath again for a count of 4.<br>
<br>Repeat: Continue this pattern for several minutes.<p>
