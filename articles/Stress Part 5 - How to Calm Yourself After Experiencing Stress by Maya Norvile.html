    <h2>"Stress: Part 5 - How to Calm Yourself After Experiencing Stress" by Maya Šustickienė</h2>
    <p>When faced with bad news or unfair criticism, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. You might find your vision blurring, your temples throbbing, or feel like you're short of breath. In those moments, it’s crucial to manage your breathing quickly; the longer you remain in this heightened state, the harder it becomes to calm down.<p>
<p><strong>Breathing Techniques for Stress Relief</strong><p>
<p>To regain control, start by practicing deep belly breathing. This technique helps reduce nervous system activation and muscle tension, making it easier to relax. Here’s a simple breathing exercise you can try:<p>
<p>1.Inhale Deeply: Calmly breathe in through your nose, counting to four as you expand your belly (not your chest).<p>
<p>2.Hold Your Breath: Hold your breath for another count of four.<p>
<p>3.Exhale Slowly: Slowly exhale through your mouth while counting to six. Focus on letting go of the tension.<p>
<p>4.Pause Again: After exhaling, hold your breath for a count of four before starting the process again.<p>
<p>Repeat this cycle for about 3-5 minutes. You’ll likely notice that your heart rate begins to slow and you feel more centered.<p>
<p><strong>Preparing in Advance</strong><p>
<p>When stressed, many people forget how to breathe normally. To prepare yourself for stressful moments, practice calming breathing techniques when you’re in a relaxed state. Here’s how:<p>
<p>1.Deep Breaths: Inhale deeply, holding your breath for as long as you comfortably can.<p>
<p>2.Calm Exhalations: Take several calm inhales and exhales, then take another deep breath and hold it.<p>
<p>3.Repeat: Do this a few times to train your body to respond to stress with calm breathing.<p>
<p><strong>Self-Massage for Quick Relief</strong><p>
<p>In addition to controlled breathing, self-massage can be incredibly helpful for quickly reducing tension. Focus on the area around your neck and shoulders:<p>
<p>*Gentle Stroking: Use your fingers to gently stroke the skin on your neck and shoulders.<p>
<p>*Kneading: Apply gentle pressure to tight muscles, kneading them as you would dough.<p>
<p>*Tapping: Lightly tap on your shoulders and the back of your neck to stimulate blood flow and ease tension.<p>
<p><strong>Taking Control of Stress</strong><p>
<p>Experiencing stress is a normal part of life, but how you respond can make a significant difference. By incorporating breathing techniques and self-massage into your routine, you can equip yourself with the tools to manage stress more effectively, you can calm your mind and body, making it easier to handle life's challenges. These strategies not only help you regain your composure in the moment but can also improve your overall well-being in the long run. The more you practice these techniques, the better you’ll be at applying them when you need them most.<p>
