        <h2>"When the Flowers Bloom but You Don‚Äôt: Spring & Depression" by Maya Norvile</h2>
<p><strong>‚ÄúTo everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.‚Äù
‚Äî Ecclesiastes 3:1</strong><p>
<p>Sometimes, the outside world is blooming, but inside, you feel like winter hasn‚Äôt left yet.
This verse is a quiet reminder: it‚Äôs okay to be in a different season than everyone else.
There‚Äôs a time for everything ‚Äî even for slowing down, even for not blooming yet.<p>
<p>Spring is supposed to be the season of hope. Sunshine, blossoms, longer days‚Ä¶ nature wakes up, birds sing, and everyone talks about ‚Äúfresh starts.‚Äù
But when you're struggling with depression or anxiety, spring doesn‚Äôt always feel like a fresh start. It can feel like pressure. Like the world is moving on without you.<p>
<p>I remember days when the sun would shine through my window, and instead of feeling happy, I felt annoyed. The light felt too bright. The birds too loud. I would hear people say, ‚ÄúWhat a beautiful day!‚Äù ‚Äî and I just felt numb. Or guilty. Like I was supposed to be happy but wasn‚Äôt. Like something was wrong with me.<p>
<p>If you've ever felt this, you're not alone.<p>
<p>And you‚Äôre not broken.<p>
<p><strong>Spring Can Feel Like Pressure</strong><p>
<p>There‚Äôs this silent expectation that we should be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù once the seasons change. That the sun and flowers should fix us. But mental health doesn‚Äôt work like that. Sunshine doesn‚Äôt erase sadness. Blossoms don‚Äôt fix burnout. If anything, the contrast ‚Äî between how the world looks and how we feel ‚Äî can make things harder.<p>
<p><strong>It‚Äôs Okay If You‚Äôre Not Blooming Yet</strong><p>
<p>Some of us are still in winter inside.<p>
<p>And that‚Äôs okay.<p>
<p>Healing doesn‚Äôt follow the seasons.<p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to bloom just because the flowers are.<p>
<p><strong>Gentle Ways to Survive Spring</strong><p>
<p>If spring feels heavy right now, maybe try some soft things. Nothing big. Nothing forced.<p>
<p>1. Let yourself rest without guilt ‚Äî even when it‚Äôs sunny.<p>
<p>2. Try a walk at your own pace, not to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù but just to breathe.<p>
<p>3. Wear comfy clothes. Be soft with yourself.<p>
<p>4. Light a candle. Open a window. Take in one small good thing, if you can.<p>
<p>5. Say no to plans if you need to. Or bring a quiet friend with you if you go.<p>
<p><strong>You Don‚Äôt Have to Pretend</strong><p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to fake being happy because the world looks bright.<p>
<p>You don‚Äôt have to keep up with the energy of spring.<p>
<p>You‚Äôre allowed to feel how you feel ‚Äî even if it doesn‚Äôt match the season.<p>
<p>Maybe this year, spring doesn‚Äôt mean blooming. Maybe it just means slowly thawing. Quietly waking up. Or just surviving.
And that‚Äôs still okay.<p>
<p>You‚Äôre not behind. You‚Äôre not failing. You‚Äôre human. üå∏</p>
