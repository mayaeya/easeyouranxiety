        <h2>"When the Flowers Bloom but You Don’t: Spring & Depression" by Maya Šustickienė</h2>
<p><strong>“To everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven.”
— Ecclesiastes 3:1</strong><p>
<p>Sometimes, the outside world is blooming, but inside, you feel like winter hasn’t left yet.
This verse is a quiet reminder: it’s okay to be in a different season than everyone else.
There’s a time for everything — even for slowing down, even for not blooming yet.<p>
<p>Spring is supposed to be the season of hope. Sunshine, blossoms, longer days… nature wakes up, birds sing, and everyone talks about “fresh starts.”
But when you're struggling with depression or anxiety, spring doesn’t always feel like a fresh start. It can feel like pressure. Like the world is moving on without you.<p>
<p>I remember days when the sun would shine through my window, and instead of feeling happy, I felt annoyed. The light felt too bright. The birds too loud. I would hear people say, “What a beautiful day!” — and I just felt numb. Or guilty. Like I was supposed to be happy but wasn’t. Like something was wrong with me.<p>
<p>If you've ever felt this, you're not alone.<p>
<p>And you’re not broken.<p>
<p><strong>Spring Can Feel Like Pressure</strong><p>
<p>There’s this silent expectation that we should be “better” once the seasons change. That the sun and flowers should fix us. But mental health doesn’t work like that. Sunshine doesn’t erase sadness. Blossoms don’t fix burnout. If anything, the contrast — between how the world looks and how we feel — can make things harder.<p>
<p><strong>It’s Okay If You’re Not Blooming Yet</strong><p>
<p>Some of us are still in winter inside.<p>
<p>And that’s okay.<p>
<p>Healing doesn’t follow the seasons.<p>
<p>You don’t have to bloom just because the flowers are.<p>
<p><strong>Gentle Ways to Survive Spring</strong><p>
<p>If spring feels heavy right now, maybe try some soft things. Nothing big. Nothing forced.<p>
<p>1. Let yourself rest without guilt — even when it’s sunny.<p>
<p>2. Try a walk at your own pace, not to “enjoy” but just to breathe.<p>
<p>3. Wear comfy clothes. Be soft with yourself.<p>
<p>4. Light a candle. Open a window. Take in one small good thing, if you can.<p>
<p>5. Say no to plans if you need to. Or bring a quiet friend with you if you go.<p>
<p><strong>You Don’t Have to Pretend</strong><p>
<p>You don’t have to fake being happy because the world looks bright.<p>
<p>You don’t have to keep up with the energy of spring.<p>
<p>You’re allowed to feel how you feel — even if it doesn’t match the season.<p>
<p>Maybe this year, spring doesn’t mean blooming. Maybe it just means slowly thawing. Quietly waking up. Or just surviving.
And that’s still okay.<p>
<p>You’re not behind. You’re not failing. You’re human. 🌸</p>
