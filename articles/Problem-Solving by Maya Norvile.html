    <h2>🌟 "Problem-Solving for Anxiety and Stress" by Maya Norvile</h2>

    <p>Problems often feel overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with stress or anxiety. 😬 But there's hope! Below is a powerful guide with simple tools and steps you can take to regain control, even in your most anxious moments.</p>

    <h3>📊 The Problem-Solving Cycle</h3>
    <p>Start by naming the problem clearly. Accept that it's okay to feel stuck. Break the problem into parts and take it one step at a time. Plan, act, and reflect — that’s the cycle. You’ll get better with practice!</p>

    <h3>⚠️ Challenges to Watch For</h3>
    <p>When you’re anxious, your brain might only see a few options — or none. Don’t worry. This is normal. Avoid perfectionism and give yourself permission to try different ways without judging.</p>

    <h3>🤝 Building Your Skills</h3>
    <p>Stay motivated. Breathe deeply. Challenge your thoughts. Instead of saying “I can’t,” ask “What’s one small step I can take right now?”</p>

    <h3>🔹 Easy Problem-Solving Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Define the problem</li>
      <li>List all possible solutions</li>
      <li>Choose the best option</li>
      <li>Take action</li>
      <li>Review the results and adjust</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>👥 When It Involves Other People</h3>
    <p>Stick to one issue at a time. Listen as much as you talk. Be kind, be clear, and stay in the present moment. You’re not alone in this.</p>

    <h3>📊 Long-Term Benefits</h3>
    <p>These skills will lower your stress, help your confidence grow, and give you tools to handle future challenges calmly and clearly. ✨</p>

    <p>You’ve got this! Start small, keep going, and don’t forget to celebrate progress along the way. 🎉</p>
