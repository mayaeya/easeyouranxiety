<p>10. Ear Seed / Shen Men Press ‚Äî Place an ear seed or use your fingertip to massage the Shen Men point in the upper ear triangle for 2 minutes, which can lower anxiety and promote relaxation.</p>
<p>11. Pericardium 6 (P6) Point ‚Äî Press firmly on your inner forearm three finger-widths from the wrist for 1 minute to relieve nausea and jitters by regulating autonomic signals </p>
