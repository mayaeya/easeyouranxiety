  <h2>"üå°Ô∏è When Stress Makes You Sick" by Maya Norvile</h2>
  <p>Yesterday my friend told me she had a fever ‚Äî but the real story was much deeper than just being unwell.</p>
  <p>She had gone through a very painful emotional conflict. Her body started shivering. She tried to hold herself together. But something wasn‚Äôt right.</p>
  <p> Then, she went to work. She cried, she was shaking, she vomited. Later, during lunch, she had to run out of the canteen and vomit again. She couldn't finish her shift and went home feeling broken and still unwell the next morning.</p>
  <p>This is not just stress. This is the body <em>shutting down</em>.</p>

  <h2>üß† What Happens Inside When Stress Hits Hard?</h2>
  <p>When the emotional pain is too strong, the body thinks it's in danger ‚Äî even if there‚Äôs no physical threat.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adrenaline and cortisol</strong> rush into your system.</li>
    <li>Your heart races. Breathing shortens. Muscles tighten.</li>
    <li>Blood leaves your stomach ‚Äî which can cause <em>nausea or vomiting</em>.</li>
    <li>You might start <em>shivering</em> or even feel like you have a fever.</li>
    <li>If this continues too long, your body says: <em>I can‚Äôt</em> ‚Äî and you crash.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è Should You Go to Work When You're Falling Apart?</h2>
  <p>If your body is vomiting, shaking, crying, shutting down ‚Äî that‚Äôs a <strong>clear NO</strong>. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúbe strong.‚Äù You need care.</p>
  <p>But what if you're already at work?</p>

  <h2>üå¨Ô∏è Emergency Coping Steps (When You‚Äôre Falling Apart at Work)</h2>
  <h3>1. Ground Your Body</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Splash cold water on your hands or face.</li>
    <li>Press your feet into the ground. Feel the floor.</li>
    <li>Hold something solid.</li>
    <li>Name 5 things you can see.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2. Breathe to Reset Your System</h3>
  <p>Try this: <br>
  ü™∞ Inhale 4 seconds ‚Üí Hold 2 ‚Üí Exhale 4 seconds. Repeat for 2‚Äì3 minutes.</p>

  <h3>3. Connect With Someone Safe</h3>
  <p>Text a friend. Nervous systems calm down when we feel connected.</p>

  <h3>4. Move the Stress Out</h3>
  <p>Shake your hands. Roll your shoulders. Even tiny movement helps.</p>

  <h3>5. Use the Toilet as a Safe Space</h3>
  <p>Need to cry? Vomit? Breathe? Hide? The toilet is your private zone.</p>

  <h3>6. Aftercare Is Healing, Not Lazy</h3>
  <p>Drink warm tea. Eat soup. Wrap in a blanket. Rest. You are healing.</p>

  <h2>üî¨ What Long-Term Stress Does to the Brain</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Amygdala</strong>: Fires up more, making fear stronger.</li>
    <li><strong>Hippocampus</strong>: Shrinks, making memory and emotions harder to process.</li>
    <li><strong>Prefrontal cortex</strong>: Goes offline, so thinking clearly feels impossible.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üå± How to Heal (When You‚Äôre Not in Panic Mode)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gentle movement</strong> (yoga, stretching, tai chi)</li>
    <li><strong>Mindfulness</strong> (body scans, breathing, guided meditations)</li>
    <li><strong>Journaling or voice notes</strong> to release emotions</li>
    <li><strong>Stay connected</strong> to safe people</li>
    <li><strong>Sleep, warmth, calm</strong> ‚Äì more than usual</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üíï To Anyone Who Feels Broken</h2>
  <blockquote>
    You‚Äôre not broken. You‚Äôre not crazy. And you‚Äôre not alone.
    <br><br>
    Your body is talking. It‚Äôs asking for care, for safety, for love.
    <br><br>
    Let‚Äôs stop calling it "just stress." Let‚Äôs call it what it is:
    <br><strong>the body asking to be held.</strong>
  </blockquote>
  <p>‚úß Written with love for my friend, and anyone else who has ever cried at work, vomited from anxiety, or felt their body crash from holding in too much. You are not alone. ‚úß</p>
