    <p>In Hindu philosophy, the word “Maya” means illusion — but it’s not a bad thing. It doesn’t mean lies or fake things. It means that the world we see — the outside world, full of noise, pressure, fear — is like a dream <span class="floating-sparkle">🌙</span>. It feels real, but it’s not the full truth. The real truth lives inside us — in our spirit, our calm, our deep self <span class="floating-sparkle">✨</span>. This idea fits so well with what we write about. Many people feel lost because they believe everything they see outside — how they should live, how they should look, how they should feel. But these are the illusions. Our work is about helping people let go of those illusions, and come back to their real self — peaceful, strong, and full of light <span class="floating-sparkle">💛</span>.</p>

<p>Maya World is not just a name. It’s a space I created from my heart <span class="floating-sparkle">💫</span>. The word “World” means more than just a place. For me, it means a small universe where I can share thoughts, healing, softness, hope, and honesty <span class="floating-sparkle">🌸</span>. It’s a world where emotions are allowed. Where people don’t have to hide their pain or pretend to be okay. A world where anxiety, depression, fear — all those things — are not something to be ashamed of <span class="floating-sparkle">🫶</span>.</p>

<p>It’s also my world — because I am Maya. I’ve been through darkness <span class="floating-sparkle">🌧️</span>. I’ve felt broken, lost, tired. And now I’m using my voice to help others feel less alone <span class="floating-sparkle">🕊️</span>. So Maya World is both personal and open — it’s my journey, but also a safe space for others to explore their own. A quiet, gentle world, far from the noise of social media and pressure <span class="floating-sparkle">🧘‍♀️</span>. A world where healing can begin <span class="floating-sparkle">🌿</span>.</p>

<p>Even though the name Maya World came from my own journey, this world is not just mine anymore. Along the way, beautiful souls have joined me — like Hema and Dovilė <span class="floating-sparkle">🌈</span>. Each of them brings their own gifts, energy, and care into this space. Together, we are creating something fuller, more colourful, more supportive <span class="floating-sparkle">🤍</span>. It’s still Maya’s World, but now it’s also a world where other voices, other hearts, are heard too. And that makes it even more special <span class="floating-sparkle">✨</span>.</p>
