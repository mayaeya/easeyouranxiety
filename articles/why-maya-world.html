    <!-- ABOUT US SECTION -->
<div>
  <p>Ease Your Anxiety is a quiet, gentle space for anyone feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or just tired of pretending to be okay. <span class="floating-sparkle">🌿</span></p>
    <p>This is not a brand. Not a loud, flashy website. And definitely not a place for fake positivity or quick-fix advice. <span class="floating-sparkle">🚫</span> It was born from real struggles — anxiety, depression, social fear — and the deep wish to help others feel less alone. <span class="floating-sparkle">🤍</span></p>
    <p>Behind this space is me, Maya — someone who’s been through the heavy stuff too. I know how it feels when your heart is tired and your mind won’t rest. That’s why I created this — not to impress, but to offer something I was missing: a quiet home for calm, connection, and honest healing. <span class="floating-sparkle">💖</span></p>
    <p>We don’t chase followers. We don’t do trends. We simply share calm words, soft thoughts, and gentle reminders that it’s okay to feel how you feel <span class="floating-sparkle">🕊️</span>. You don’t have to be perfect here. You don’t have to hide your pain. Everything you are — even the messy parts — is welcome. <span class="floating-sparkle">🌧️</span></p>
    <p>Ease Your Anxiety is a social-media-free zone. No noise. No pressure. Just a safe corner of the internet where you can breathe, slow down, and maybe start healing at your own pace. <span class="floating-sparkle">🧘‍♀️</span></p>
    <p>Over time, other beautiful souls — like Hema and Dovilė — joined this space. Each one brings care, softness, and support. Together, we’re holding space for people who feel overwhelmed, carry too much pressure, care too deeply, or are simply exhausted from holding it all together. <span class="floating-sparkle">✨</span></p>
    <p>If you’re here, maybe your heart needs rest. We hope this place can offer it.</p>
