<p>Panic attacks can feel intense and overwhelming ‚Äî but there are ways to calm your mind and body. <strong>Grounding techniques</strong> are simple tools that bring your attention back to the present moment. In this article, we‚Äôll explore how grounding can help you manage panic attacks when they show up.</p>

  <li><strong>Nausea</strong>: Feeling sick or uneasy in your stomach.</li>
  <li><strong>Dizziness</strong>: You might feel lightheaded or like you're going to faint.</li>
  <li><strong>Sense of Unreality</strong>: You may feel disconnected from your surroundings or like something terrible is about to happen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Grounding Techniques to Help You Feel Safe</h2>
<p>When a panic attack begins, grounding exercises can help shift your attention from fear to the present. Here are a few you can try:</p>

<h3>1. üåà 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>5 things you can see</strong>: Look around and name five things you can see. Say them out loud or in your mind.</li>
  <li><strong>4 things you can touch</strong>: Notice how things feel ‚Äî your clothes, a chair, or anything close to you.</li>
  <li><strong>3 things you can hear</strong>: Listen carefully. Try to find three different sounds.</li>
  <li><strong>2 things you can smell</strong>: Notice any scents around you. If you can‚Äôt smell anything, think of a scent you like.</li>
  <li><strong>1 thing you can taste</strong>: Taste something nearby or just remember a taste you enjoy.</li>
</ul>
<p>This technique helps bring you back into your body and out of the panic spiral.</p>

<h3>2. üßò Grounding with Breathing and Counting</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Breathe In</strong>: Slowly breathe in through your nose while counting to 4.</li>
  <li><strong>Hold</strong>: Gently hold your breath for 4 seconds.</li>
  <li><strong>Exhale</strong>: Exhale slowly through your mouth while counting to 4 again.</li>
  <li><strong>Repeat</strong>: Keep doing this for a few minutes, focusing on your breath and the count.</li>
</ul>
<p>This rhythm helps your nervous system calm down and brings your focus away from fear.</p>

<h3>3. üñêÔ∏è Engage Your Senses</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Touch</strong>: Hold something soft, textured, or cool. Squeeze a stress ball or run cold water on your hands.</li>
  <li><strong>Taste or Smell</strong>: Chew gum, drink tea, or smell something calming like lavender oil.</li>
  <li><strong>Move</strong>: Stretch your hands, stand up, or walk a few steps. Feel your feet on the floor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using your senses connects your body and mind to the present ‚Äî which is where safety is.</p>
