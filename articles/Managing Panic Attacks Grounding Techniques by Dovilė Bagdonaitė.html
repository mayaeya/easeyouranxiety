      <h2>🌱 "Managing Panic Attacks: Grounding Techniques" by Dovilė Bagdonaitė</h2>

      <p>Panic attacks can feel intense and overwhelming — but there are ways to calm your mind and body. <strong>Grounding techniques</strong> are simple tools that bring your attention back to the present moment. 🌍 In this article, we’ll explore how grounding can help you manage panic attacks when they show up.</p>

      <h2>⚠️ Recognizing the Signs of a Panic Attack</h2>
      <p>Panic attacks often come suddenly and feel strong. Here are some common signs you might notice:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Increased Heart Rate</strong>: Your heart might race or beat irregularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty Breathing</strong>: You may feel like you can’t catch your breath.</li>
        <li><strong>Sweating</strong>: Sudden and heavy sweating, even if you're not hot.</li>
        <li><strong>Shaking or Trembling</strong>: Your body might shake on its own.</li>
        <li><strong>Chest Discomfort</strong>: A tight or uncomfortable feeling in your chest.</li>
        <li><strong>Nausea</strong>: Feeling sick or uneasy in your stomach.</li>
        <li><strong>Dizziness</strong>: You might feel lightheaded or like you're going to faint.</li>
        <li><strong>Sense of Unreality</strong>: You may feel disconnected or like something terrible is about to happen.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🧘‍♀️ Grounding Techniques to Help You Feel Safe</h2>
      <p>When a panic attack begins, grounding exercises can help shift your attention from fear to the present. Here are a few you can try:</p>

      <h3>1. 🌈 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>5 things you can see</strong>: Look around and name five things you can see.</li>
        <li><strong>4 things you can touch</strong>: Notice how things feel — your clothes, a chair, or anything close to you.</li>
        <li><strong>3 things you can hear</strong>: Listen carefully. Try to find three different sounds.</li>
        <li><strong>2 things you can smell</strong>: Notice any scents around you or imagine one you like.</li>
        <li><strong>1 thing you can taste</strong>: Taste something nearby or remember a favourite taste.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This technique helps bring you back into your body and out of the panic spiral. 🌟</p>

      <h3>2. 🧘 Breathing + Counting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Breathe In</strong>: Slowly inhale through your nose while counting to 4.</li>
        <li><strong>Hold</strong>: Gently hold your breath for 4 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Exhale</strong>: Exhale through your mouth for 4 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat</strong>: Continue this cycle for a few minutes, focusing only on the rhythm.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This calms your nervous system and keeps your mind from spiraling. 🫶</p>

      <h3>3. 🖐️ Engage Your Senses</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Touch</strong>: Hold something soft or textured. Run cold water on your hands.</li>
        <li><strong>Smell & Taste</strong>: Sip tea, chew gum, or smell a calming oil like lavender.</li>
        <li><strong>Movement</strong>: Stand up, stretch, or walk a few steps. Feel your feet grounding you.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When your body connects with your surroundings, your panic slowly fades. 🌸</p>

      <h2>💛 Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>Panic attacks are tough, but you are stronger than you think. Grounding techniques won’t erase the anxiety, but they will give you power to manage it. You deserve peace, and every grounding breath is a step closer.</p>
      <p>You're doing amazing — one breath at a time. 🌬️✨</p>
