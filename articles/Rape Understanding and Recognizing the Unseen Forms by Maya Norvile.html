        <h2>"Rape: Understanding and Recognizing the Unseen Forms" by Maya Norvile</h2>
        <p>🕊️ Rape is a horrific crime that leaves deep emotional, psychological, and physical scars. While many people understand the typical definition, there are hidden forms that society often overlooks. This article shines light on those dark corners and supports survivors in recognizing their experiences.</p>

        <p><strong>Understanding Consent 💬</strong></p>
        <p>Consent must be clear, voluntary, and enthusiastic. It can never be assumed and should never come through manipulation, pressure, or while someone is incapacitated. No means no. Silence is not yes. Past consent is not future consent.</p>

        <p><strong>Types of Rape Often Overlooked:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>💔 Marital Rape</strong> – Even within marriage, consent is essential. No one is entitled to your body.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Date Rape</strong> – Trust is broken when someone you know and maybe like forces or manipulates you into sex.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Acquaintance Rape</strong> – Not just strangers. Friends, classmates, coworkers can cross boundaries.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Coercive Rape</strong> – Threats, guilt, pressure – none of that is consent. You deserve freedom of choice.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Stealthing</strong> – Removing a condom without permission changes the agreement. It's rape.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Statutory Rape</strong> – Children can't consent. Even if they say yes, the law says no.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Rape by Deception</strong> – If consent is based on lies, it’s not real consent.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Incestuous Rape</strong> – When family crosses a boundary, it brings deep betrayal and trauma.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Incapacitated Rape</strong> – Consent can’t happen when someone is asleep, drunk, or drugged.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Intimate Partner Sexual Violence</strong> – Love should never hurt. Being in a relationship doesn’t mean saying yes forever.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Workplace Sexual Assault</strong> – Power can be used to abuse. You do not owe anyone sex to keep your job.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Corrective Rape</strong> – Trying to "fix" someone’s identity with violence is hate and horror.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Survival Sex</strong> – Trading sex for food, shelter, or safety is not a real choice—it’s exploitation.</p>
        <p><strong>💔 Drug-Facilitated Assault</strong> – When someone drugs your drink to silence your will, it’s a criminal act.</p>

        <p><strong>Recognizing the Signs 🔍</strong></p>
        <p>Feelings of violation, discomfort, fear, or confusion after a sexual act are red flags. You may feel something was wrong even if you can’t explain it right away. Trust your gut.</p>

        <p><strong>Reporting and Getting Help 📞</strong></p>
        <p>Rape is NEVER your fault. If you have experienced it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🏥 Seek medical care immediately.</li>
            <li>🧾 Preserve any physical evidence.</li>
            <li>👮‍♀️ Report to authorities if you're ready.</li>
            <li>🫂 Reach out to crisis centers or therapy for support.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let’s build a world that sees and hears every survivor. 💙 Healing is possible, and justice matters. You are not alone.</p>
