      <h2>"Fighting Depression Alone: Part 10 - The Morning I Woke Up Gasping for Air" by Maya Eya</h2>

      <p>üòî I woke up today in full-blown panic. My heart was racing. My breath‚Äîgone. It felt like I was choking on invisible fear. I sat up in bed, shaking, hands gripping the sheets, thinking *not again, please not again*. This is anxiety at its worst. No warning. No reason. Just terror.</p>

      <p>I reached for the tablet. The same tablets I‚Äôve been trying so hard not to take. But this time, my body didn‚Äôt give me a choice. I needed one just to calm down. And then later‚Äîanother one, just to function. Just to survive the day.</p>

      <p>This is what it‚Äôs like to live with anxiety and panic attacks. To wake up already exhausted. To fight your own brain before you‚Äôve even had breakfast. üò©</p>

      <p>I feel like I‚Äôm losing myself again.</p>

      <p>There was a time I used to wake up with excitement. I was full of plans. I would book holidays on a whim, laugh without fear, go out surrounded by people, and feel like I belonged somewhere. I loved life. I loved the noise, the colours, the chaos. üåç‚ú®</p>

      <p>Now I hide from it all.</p>

      <p>I watch the world carry on from behind a foggy window, and I keep asking‚Äî*Where did that girl go?* The one who smiled, who made things happen, who felt things deeply but wasn‚Äôt afraid of those feelings.</p>

      <p>Today I felt like giving up. Not forever. But just for a while. To pause this pain. To stop being at war with my own mind.</p>

      <p>I‚Äôm tired. Of waking up like this. Of surviving like this. Of swallowing tablets and swallowing tears.</p>

      <p>I miss <em>me</em>. The real me.</p>

      <p>But maybe‚Ä¶ maybe writing this is a way of holding on. üìù</p>
