<h4>My Journey Through Depression and Healing</h4>
<p>Healing from depression is not a straight road. It’s messy, slow, and deeply personal. 🌞 These days, I smile more. I laugh with my friends. I feel the sun on my face, and I enjoy it. I can go for a walk and feel… okay. Sometimes even happy.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t always like this.</p>
<p>There was a time when I couldn’t feel anything at all. A time when I didn’t even realise I had depression. I just thought something was wrong with me. I felt heavy, tired, and lost. I didn’t understand myself. I couldn’t see what was happening inside me.</p>
<p>When I read the things I wrote back then, during my darkest days, I feel two things. First—I feel sad. 😔 Sad that I had to feel that much pain. That I ever believed those dark thoughts. But second—I feel thankful. 🌿 Because I don’t feel that way anymore.</p>
<p>There was a time I couldn’t speak to people properly. I couldn’t connect. No joy, no interest in life. I felt like I didn’t matter. Like nobody cared about me. I believed the world would be better without me. That I wasn’t needed, or loved. I just wanted everything to stop.</p>
<p>I wanted to get rid of all those feelings. That pressure on my chest. That darkness in my head. I wanted to die.</p>
<p>But now… things are different. ✨</p>
<p>Even if I still have bad days sometimes, I also have good days. And that is the biggest difference.</p>
<p>I can feel joy again. I can laugh. I can talk with people and feel the connection. I can see the beauty in small things—like the sun, a candle, a kind word. 🕯️☀️</p>
<p>I’m not fully healed yet. But I’m healing. 💛</p>
<p>Depression took a few years of my life. But it didn’t take all of me. I’m still here. I’m stronger now. And I truly believe that one day, I’ll be fully okay.</p>
<p>That day is on the way. 🌈</p>
<p>And today… I’m smiling. 😊</p>
