    <h2>"Fighting Depression Alone: Part 3 - Nightmares" by Maya Norvile</h2>
    <p>In the midst of my battle with depression, nights became my refuge and my battleground. When my medication finally changed to something promising sleep, I yearned for those evenings, those moments when I could take a pill and slip away into rest.<p>
<p>But some nights, like the one that haunts me now, sleep brings no solace. Instead, I find myself trapped in the same recurring nightmare. Darkness surrounds me, and I sense his presence approaching—a fear so palpable it paralyzes me. I know what's coming, yet I'm powerless to move, to escape.<p>
<p>Waking abruptly, my heart races, and the room feels suffocatingly real. I check the lights, reassure myself with the presence of my cat nestled nearby. I am safe, but the fear lingers, clutching at my chest, making each breath a struggle.<p>
<p>Desperate for comfort, I reach out to my cat, but he shifts away, seeking his own peace in slumber. Alone in the night, I face another sleepless stretch, the weight of exhaustion and dread heavy upon me. Tomorrow, I must work, but from the safety of my home. No one will see the turmoil within.<p>
<p>Each night like this is a reminder of the solitary struggle against depression. It's not just about the dark thoughts or the sadness—it's about the nights where sleep eludes, and nightmares haunt. Yet, somehow, each morning arrives, and I gather the strength to face another day, carrying the weight of my unseen battles.<p>
<p>In these moments, I find solace in small comforts: the soft glow of a lamp, the rhythmic purr of my cat, and the knowledge that amidst the darkness, I continue to fight. This journey may be lonely, but I am not alone in my resilience.<p>
