   <h2>"Lonely Christmas" by Maya Šustickienė</h2>

<p>Hema told me: "We are alone during Christmas, and almost everyone in our family is in Lithuania." Hearing this, I thought about my past Christmases and how I spent them. 🎄</p>
<p>I have never been a fan of spending Christmas the way my family did when I was a kid. But I am thankful to my mum, who showed me the Christmas spirit. ✨</p>
<p>Most of my Christmases, I spent with myself, and it was amazing. I had some Christmas food, watched Christmas movies, and decorated my bedroom with Christmas decorations. 🎁🍪 Christmas time has always been my favorite time of the year. I never thought I needed someone to make it Christmas. I was okay on my own. I was cheerful and happy with myself on Christmas days. I never felt lonely. I even bought Christmas presents for myself. 🎀</p>
<p>Christmas Eve always smelled of Christmas candles and mince pies, and the room was filled with Christmas songs. On Christmas Day, I would wake up happy and with a Christmas mood that most people don’t have even when they are with their families. 🎶🕯️ Everything was nice and cheerful. I was with myself. I was happy. 😊</p>
<p>Now, I am even happier. I have my cat with me. 🐾 I am not alone anymore. But yes, for others, it is sad to hear that I am on my own for Christmas. But they don’t know. They don’t know so much about me and my life. They don’t know that the times I spent Christmas not alone were mostly when I wasn’t happy and would have rather spent time alone.</p>
<p>Am I weird? I don’t know. But I know I am okay, even if people think it is not okay. Just let me be happy. 💫</p>
<p>This year, as Christmas approaches, I find myself reflecting on the joy I’ve always found in my own company. The twinkling lights, the cozy nights, the smell of pine and cinnamon – these are the things that make Christmas special for me. 🌟 Even now, with my cat by my side, I feel a sense of peace and contentment that many would not understand. The world outside may see it as loneliness, but in my heart, it is a time of warmth and joy. 🔔</p>
<p>To those who pity me, I wish they could see what I see: the magic in solitude, the beauty in self-reliance. Christmas is not about the number of people around the table, but the love and happiness that fill the room. 💛 And for me, that love is real, even if it comes from within.</p>
