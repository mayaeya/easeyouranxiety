    <h2>"💔 When Love Was Never Real 💔" by Maya Norvile</h2>
<p>I don’t even know how to start. This pain is not just a broken heart — it’s something deeper. Something heavier.  
It hurts so much when you realise that the person you loved didn’t really love you back... they never did. 😔</p>

<p>There’s a kind of pain that doesn't come from being alone — it comes from love. Or at least what we believed was love.</p>

<p>It starts with hope. After past heartbreaks, we finally let someone in. We believe their promises. We feel seen again. Alive again. Safe.  
We build dreams — not castles in the air, but a home in the heart.  
They made us feel like we were loved, like they cared. And then suddenly, everything starts falling apart.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the person we love never truly saw us as someone to love.  
Only someone to use. A step. A plan. An advantage.  
And when they got what they wanted, they changed.  
They became cold. Distant. Cruel.  
They stopped replying. They allowed others to insult you.  
They didn’t even deny hurting you — <strong>because your pain meant nothing to them.</strong></p>

<p>And the worst part?  
They made you feel like it was your fault.  
They said you’re weak.  
Too emotional.  
Broken.  
Too much.  
Not enough.  
🕳️ Like your anxiety made you unworthy of love.</p>

<p>But they never saw that your anxiety didn’t make you weak — it made you stronger than most.  
Because even with fear in your chest, you still chose love.  
You still gave your heart.  
And they took it, crushed it, and walked away without a single look back. 🥀</p>

<p>You still love them. You still search for the person you thought they were.  
You still try to fix something that was broken from the beginning — not by you, but by their intention.</p>

<p>This kind of "love" doesn’t just break your heart.  
It breaks your self-worth.  
It increases anxiety.  
It brings back old pain.  
It makes you question if you’re good enough — when the truth is, you were always too good for someone who never planned to hold your heart gently.</p>

<p>Being used, especially when you're already healing from the past, is one of the most soul-destroying things.  
You want to be strong, but you feel weak.  
You want to move on, but something inside still loves the version of them that never existed.</p>

<p>To anyone reading this: if you’ve ever felt used, broken, unseen — you’re not alone.  
You’re not crazy.  
You’re not weak.  
You just loved real in a world where too many people don’t. 💔</p>

<p>If this is your story, let this remind you:  
You didn’t lose them.  
They lost someone real.  
Someone honest.  
Someone strong — even in pain.</p>

<p>You texted. You cried.  
They ignored every message like you never mattered.  
They ghosted you like a stranger.  
After everything.  
And still — your heart whispered: “I love you.”</p>

<p>That’s what hurts the most.  
To love someone who only pretended to love you back.  
To realise they never saw you — only what they could get from you. 😔💔</p>

<p>You can’t sleep. You can't eat.  
You feel broken in places you didn't know could break.  
Your chest aches. Your stomach tightens.  
Your mind replays memories on a loop — the good ones, the lies.  
And you wonder, <em>Was anything real?</em></p>

<p>The answer? Your love was real. 💗  
<em>Theirs never was.</em></p>

<p>And now… you're left rebuilding yourself with shaking hands.  
Trying to breathe with a crushed soul.  
Trying to move on with a heart that still whispers their name in the dark.</p>

<p>To the one who did this:  
You didn’t just break a heart.  
You destroyed something fragile and beautiful.  
You used someone who was already bleeding and called it love.</p>

<p>To those who take advantage of people already hurting — you may not see the damage you cause.  
But the silence, the lies, the pretending — it destroys more than a heart.  
It destroys trust, mental health, even the will to believe again.</p>

<p>One day, maybe, you’ll feel what you did.  
Maybe you won’t.  
But they’ll rise — even if it's with tears in their eyes and scars on their soul. 🌧️🕊️</p>

<p>This isn’t just pain.  
This is survival.  
This is the voice of someone who still loves, even after being destroyed.  
And that… is strength you will never understand.</p>

<p>🌹 To anyone reading this who knows this pain — I see you. I am you. And I promise… we will heal. One tear at a time. 💧</p>

<p>🖤 You are not alone. You will rise. Even from this. 🖤</p>
