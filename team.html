      <h2>Maya</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Maya. <span class="float-emoji">👋</span> I’ve faced depression and still manage anxiety, so I know how hard it can be. <span class="float-emoji">💙</span> Along the way, I’ve learned from my own experiences, NHS staff, psychologists, and my university years — all to find ways to heal and feel better. </p>

      <p>That’s why I created <em>Ease Your Anxiety</em>: a place to share helpful advice, stories, and creative tools to support your mental health journey. </p>

      <p>I’m also the author of <em>Happy: Emotional Colouring</em>, a book designed to bring joy and relaxation through creativity and colours. <span class="float-emoji">🎨🖌️</span></p>

      <p>I hope this space feels kind and supportive — a place where you feel understood and inspired. Thanks for being here. We’re in this together. </p>

      <h2>Hema</h2>
      <p>My name is Hema Kusk (Žiedūnė). Currently, I am the director of an architectural design company, and I have a great passion for the arts, including painting, photography, poetry, and writing short essays.</p>
      <p>I am also keenly interested in art therapy. My sister has disabilities, which inspired me to research ways to help her and others with similar challenges. I discovered that art and art therapy can significantly aid in managing complex disabilities.</p>
      <p>In 2014, I opened an art studio in Lithuania called “Art Room,” which also functioned as an art gallery to help disabled individuals sell their artwork. It collaborated with various organizations on social integration projects. I also spoke on radio and was featured in “Kaunas Day.”</p>
      <p>Later, I worked at Kaunas Technology University with international students, helping them use art for stress relief. After moving to the UK in 2017, I joined the Peterborough Society of Arts and participated in exhibitions.</p>
      <p>Now, as a mother, I’ve reduced my activities but continue to create through writing and painting.<span class="float-emoji">💖</span></p>

      <h2>Dovilė</h2>
      <p>Hi, I’m Dovilė — one of the faces behind Ease Your Anxiety. From a young age, I felt a strong empathy for others, which led me to study psychology and mental health support. <span class="float-emoji">💛✨</span></p>

      <p>My goal is to help people navigate tough emotions and challenges with practical, kind advice. Here at Ease Your Anxiety, I share what I’ve learned to empower you on your mental health journey. <span class="float-emoji">🌱💪</span></p>

      <p>I hope this space feels safe and supportive for everyone looking for understanding and encouragement. <span class="float-emoji">🤗💫</span></p>
