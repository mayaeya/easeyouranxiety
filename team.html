      <h2>Maya</h2>
      <p>I'm Maya. In my journey with mental health, I've faced depression and continue to manage anxiety. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of the struggles many of you face every day.</p>
      <p>In my quest for healing, I‚Äôve studied a lot‚Äîexploring different self-help techniques, therapies, and holistic approaches. I‚Äôve also learned from NHS staff and my psychologist, who kindly allowed me to share some of their advice and insights. Some of the knowledge I use today also comes from my university studies in Religion Pedagogy.</p>
      <p>This mix of personal experience and professional support helped me a lot on my own healing path‚Äîand it also inspired me to help others. That‚Äôs why I created <strong>Maya World</strong>: a space to share what I‚Äôve learned, offer practical advice, and bring hope through stories, creativity, and knowledge.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm also the author of <em>Happy: Emotional Colouring</em>, a book made to bring joy and relaxation through creativity and colours. üé®</p>
      <p>I truly hope to build a kind and supportive community here‚Äîa place where you can feel understood, inspired, and supported in your journey.</p>
      <p>Thank you for being part of Maya World ‚Äî we‚Äôre here for you, every step of the way.</p>

      <h2>Hema</h2>
      <p>My name is Hema Kusk (≈Ωied≈´nƒó). Currently, I am the director of an architectural design company, and I have a great passion for the arts, including painting, photography, poetry, and writing short essays.</p>
      <p>I am also keenly interested in art therapy. My sister has disabilities, which inspired me to research ways to help her and others with similar challenges. I discovered that art and art therapy can significantly aid in managing complex disabilities.</p>
      <p>In 2014, I opened an art studio in Lithuania called ‚ÄúArt Room,‚Äù which also functioned as an art gallery to help disabled individuals sell their artwork. It collaborated with various organizations on social integration projects. I also spoke on radio and was featured in ‚ÄúKaunas Day.‚Äù</p>
      <p>Later, I worked at Kaunas Technology University with international students, helping them use art for stress relief. After moving to the UK in 2017, I joined the Peterborough Society of Arts and participated in exhibitions.</p>
      <p>Now, as a mother, I‚Äôve reduced my activities but continue to create through writing and painting.</p>

      <h2>Dovilƒó</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Dovilƒó, another face behind Maya World. From a young age, I discovered my natural empathy for others, which drove me to pursue studies in psychology and mental health support.</p>
      <p>My journey began with a focus on helping people navigate distress, overcome challenges, and support those with depressive thoughts and emotional struggles.</p>
      <p>At Maya World, I combine my knowledge and experience to provide valuable insights and effective self-help techniques. My articles blend evidence-based advice with compassionate understanding, aimed at empowering you to take control of your mental health.</p>
      <p>Through my work, I strive to create a safe and supportive community where everyone can find the resources and encouragement they need. I am passionate about helping others, and I hope my contributions to Maya World make a positive difference in your journey. üíõ</p>
