                <h2>Maya</h2>
 <p>I'm Maya. In my journey with mental health, I've faced depression and continue to manage anxiety. These experiences have given me a deep understanding of the struggles many of you face every day.</p>
<p>In my quest for healing, I’ve studied a lot—exploring different self-help techniques, therapies, and holistic approaches. I’ve also learned from NHS staff and my psychologist, who kindly allowed me to share some of their advice and insights. Some of the knowledge I use today also comes from my university studies in Religion Pedagogy.</p>
<p>This mix of personal experience and professional support helped me a lot on my own healing path—and it also inspired me to help others. That’s why I created <strong>Maya World</strong>: a space to share what I’ve learned, offer practical advice, and bring hope through stories, creativity, and knowledge.</p>
<p>I’m also the author of <em>Happy: Emotional Colouring</em>, a book made to bring joy and relaxation through creativity and colours. 🎨</p>
<p>I truly hope to build a kind and supportive community here—a place where you can feel understood, inspired, and supported in your journey.</p>
<p>Thank you for being part of Maya World — we’re here for you, every step of the way.</p>

                <h2>Hema</h2>
                <p>My name is Hema Kusk (Žiedūnė). Currently, I am the director of an architectural design company, and I have a great passion for the arts, including painting, photography, poetry, and writing short essays, and I have a great passion for the arts, including painting, photography, poetry, and writing short essays.<p>
<p>I am also keenly interested in art therapy. My sister has disabilities, which inspired me to research ways to help her and others with similar challenges. I discovered that art and art therapy can significantly aid in managing complex disabilities. In 2014, I opened an art studio in Lithuania called “Art Room,” which also functioned as an art gallery to help disabled individuals sell their artwork. "Art Room" collaborated with various organizations on numerous social integration projects, using art as a tool to assist people with disabilities. Additionally, I frequently spoke on the radio about social integration, which was another initiative of my art studio. My activities were also featured in a newspaper article “Kaunas Day”.<p>
<p>I also worked at Kaunas Technology University with international students, helping them use art as a stress relief after their studies.<p>
<p>In 2017, I moved to the UK and joined the Peterborough Society of Arts and participated in several art exhibitions in the UK. Recently, I became a mother and naturally had to reduce my activities due to family commitments. However, I continue to practice writing and painting.</p>

                <h2>Dovilė</h2>
               <p>Hi, I'm Dovilė, another face behind Maya World. From a young age, I discovered my natural empathy for others, which drove me to pursue studies in psychology and mental health support.</p>

<p>My journey began with a focus on helping people navigate distress, overcome challenges, and support those with depressive thoughts and emotional struggles.</p>

<p>At Maya World, I combine my knowledge and experience to provide valuable insights and effective self-help techniques. My articles blend evidence-based advice with compassionate understanding, aimed at empowering you to take control of your mental health.</p>

<p>Through my work, I strive to create a safe and supportive community where everyone can find the resources and encouragement they need. I am passionate about helping others, and I hope my contributions to Maya World make a positive difference in your journey. 💛</p>
